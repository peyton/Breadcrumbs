# Breadcrumb

A fork of Apple's [*Breadcrumb* sample code](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/Breadcrumb/Introduction/Intro.html) hastily modified to log the phone's location to a CSV when in the background.

## Logging location

Open up the app and make sure it's running every once in a while.

## Exporting logs

Open your phone in the iTunes *Device* pane, click on *Apps*, and drag the CSV files into a folder.
